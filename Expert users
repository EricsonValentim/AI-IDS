This process can be performed via the PIP on the Ubuntu IDS virtual machine. 
Templates must be exported in extension (.PKL). The Examples directory has 4 examples of complete techniques to facilitate the creation and export of new models.

To facilitate the creation of new datasets we developed a script to insert the labels of benign network traffic (0) or malicious network traffic (1) after running 
the CICFlowMeter tool which generates an output file in (.CSV) format. 
After inserting the labels in this file, it is possible to train in different techniques for different types of attacks.

The preprocessing step is detailed in the preprocessing.py configuration file.
